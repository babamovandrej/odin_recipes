    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I'll say it: chocolate chip cookies are way better without the chocolate chip cookies. Don't get me wrong, I love an ooey, gooey chocolate chip cookie (especially one straight out of the oven), but have always found myself having an affinity for the bits without the chocolate chips. That's how this chocolate chipless recipe was born. It has all of the warm brown sugar flavors of a chocolate chip cookie, but without all of the chips. And because I still love chocolate, this cookie is dipped in a genius two-ingredient chocolate hard shell to still give it that classic chocolate taste (but it is, of course, optional).</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>3/4 cup unsalted butter, at room temperature</em></li>
        <li><em>1 cup brown sugar, packed</em></li>
        <li><em>1/4 cup granulated sugar</em></li>
        <li><em>1 large egg</em></li>
        <li><em>1 large egg yolk</em></li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon vanilla extract</em></li>
        <li><em>1 3/4 cups all purpose flour</em></li>
        <li><em>1 teaspoon baking soda</em></li>
        <li><em>1 teaspoon salt</em></li>
        <li><em>1/3 cup coconut oil</em></li>
        <li><em>1 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</em></li>
        <li><em>1 tablespoon flaky sea salt for garnish</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add butter to a small saucepan set over medium heat and cook,stirring constantly, until butter begins to lightly foam and turns from light yellow to golden brown, about 5 minutes. When the butter begins to brown, turn off heat and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Combine room temperature browned butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a bowl and beat with an electric mixer until well combined. Add egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and mix until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, combine flour, salt, and baking soda. Gradually add flour mixture to the butter mixture, 1 tablespoon at a time, until well combined. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or overnight, until chilled.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and line a sheet with parchment paper.</li>
        <li>Measure out 1-inch portions of the batter with a spoon or use an ice cream scoop to cut out balls. Place dough balls them on the prepared baking sheet roughly 2 inches apart.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are begin to turn just golden brown, 11 to 12 minutes. Set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>While the cookies cool, prepare the chocolate shell. Add coconut oil to a small bowl and melt in the microwave for 30 seconds. Add chocolate chips and stir until chocolate has thoroughly melted. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Once cookies are cooled completely, dip each cookie into the melted chocolate to coat half of the cookie. Set on a clean baking sheet or wax paper to harden (it will happen almost instantly). Garnish with flaky sea salt and enjoy!</li>
